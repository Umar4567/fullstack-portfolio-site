The file `public/Umar_Ahmed_Resume.pdf` is intended to be a PDF document. Since I cannot generate a PDF file directly, you will need to create or upload your resume in PDF format to the specified location. 

Please ensure that the file is named `Umar_Ahmed_Resume.pdf` and placed in the `public` directory of your project. If you have a PDF file ready, you can simply move it to that location. 

If you need help creating a PDF or have specific content for the resume, please provide the details, and I can assist you with that.
